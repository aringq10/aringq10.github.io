          \* Homework problems were:
          [distance-vector routing simulator][dv]{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
          and [recreating the ping command][ping]{:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
          The ping program was surprisingly easy to implement and it was cool to see it work almost the same as the
          original one. Distance vector alg is straightforward in theory but this simulator took quite some time to
          implement and figuring out the author's simulator code was very satisfying :).

          \* Skipped all of the calculation problems with probability and stuff, may come back to them later, but
          didn't seem very interesting.
