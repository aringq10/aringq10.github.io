# Who is Ashpimpals?

Born from the smoldering remains of ancient volcanic gods, the Ashpimpals are elemental tricksters who thrive in chaos and shadow. Cloaked in ember-cloaked rags and crowned with molten ash, they whisper forgotten secrets into the ears of wandering souls. *Neither good nor evil*, they meddle in mortal affairs for amusement or cryptic prophecy. Legends say they guard the Ember Vault, a shifting realm of fire where memories burn to fuel future destinies. Few who bargain with them return unchangedâ€”marked by glowing eyes and soot-touched hearts. The Ashpimpals vanish with dawn, leaving only warm footprints and a lingering scent of brimstone.
