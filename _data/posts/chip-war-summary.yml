    1. 1945-1965
    USA makes the first chips
  points:
    - Transistor gets invented, later replacing vacuum tubes
    - Fairchild Semiconductor and Texas Instruments starts using them, Bob Noyce and Jack Kilby invent the integrated circuit(chip).
    - Lithography gets invented.
    - Military capitalizes on the new technology(Apollo, guided missiles) and becomes the main customer of the mentioned firms.
    - Bob Noyce thinks the future of semiconductors is the civilian market.

    2. 1950-1980
    Soviets tryna catch up, USA offshoring production to Asia and sharing tech with Japan
  points:
    - Soviets try catching up by copying America's chips, they build Zelenograd, a techonology research city, but failed to accomplish any progress.
    - USA shares its technology with Japan, wanting it to grow economically. Akio Morita founds Sony.
    - American firms offshore production to Asia for cheap labor. Fairchild in Hong Kong, TI in Taiwan.
    - Noyce and Moore found Intel and are the first to produce DRAM.
    - Jerry Sanders founds AMD.
    - Pentagon needs new technology to combat Soviet quantitative advantage. So funds the industry even more.

    3. 1980s
    Japan
  points:
    - Japan starts producing higher-quality, cheaper DRAM. Taking most of its market share from USA companies.
    - This happened due to heavy state subsidies for tech firms, low rates from banks and a focus on mass production.
    - Japan(Nikon) also outperforms USA's lithography companies(GCA).
    - USA feels dependant on Japan, thus decreasing taxes for tech firms and pushing for coop.

    4. 1980-2000
    USA coming back
  points:
    - Micron(USA) starts making good DRAM.
    - Intel starts producing general CPUs.
    - USA invents software for designing chips.

    5. 1990-2010
    USA wins Cold War
  points:
    - TSMC builds a big ol' foundry, forcing firms to ditch in-house production and focus on chip design.
    - China was set back technologically from Dao's regime, Richard Chang founds SMIC, a foundry.
    - Intel bets big on ASML('cause the only other rivals were Nikon and Canon and they're japanese) to develop extreme ultraviolet light lithography tools for smaller transistors.
    - Intel dominates PC and Server sphere with x86 architecture, tho ARM appears in the iPhone.

    6. 2000-2020
    Fabless firms, TSMC on top
  points:
    - Only AMD and Intel manufacture their own chips, most of the other going fabless.
    - Logic chips mostly made by Intel and AMD. Memory - Korea(Samsung and SK hynix) and USA(Micron, tho mostly offshored). Other chips in Japan, USA and Europe.
    - NVIDIA develops GPUs for graphics rendering, later find out that they're good for AI.
    - Apple designs their own chips meaning that devices in their ecosystem work well together.
    - The BIG GAMBLE on EUV and ASML paid off, new tools come out and fulfill yet another progression for Moore's law.
    - Now TSMC and Samsung have the biggest foundries.
    - Intel, tho still profitable, lacks on inovation and falls behind in both design and manufacturing.

    7. 2000-2020
    China
  points:
    - China is so behind, only contributing to the assembly of electronics, that it sets out to reduce its semiconductor imports from 80% to 30% by ~2030.
    - China starts buying up foreign chip firms, hoping to get some technology transfered.
    - Huawei in Shenzhen has become a leader of telecom and the biggest tech company in China. It has the best technology for integrating 5G, so future looks promising.
    - USA sees China as a threat and starts planning on how to prevent it getting ahead.

    8. Today
    Export controls & chokepoints
  points:
    - Jinhua, a company in Fujian, China, steals documents from Micron to implement the technology themselves. USA responds by blocking exports of essential chip manufacturing equipment to the company.
    - Trump also bans exports of advanced chips and tools to China, 'cause Huawei's looking like a real threat.
    - USA still controls a big chunk of the semiconductor industry, especially some essential chokepoints like litography tools and chip design software.
    - Today Taiwan produces 37% of the world's logic chips and 11% of memory chips. As China is getting pressured and blocked by the USA, it may be looking to put some pressure on Taiwan, as it is now in a far better position for war than ever before.
