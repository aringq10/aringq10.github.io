        Soviets try catching up by copying America's chips, they build Zelenograd, a techonology research city, but failed to accomplish any progress.

      <li>
        USA shares its technology with Japan, wanting it to grow economically. Akio Morita founds Sony.
      </li>
      <li>
        American firms offshore production to Asia for cheap labor. Fairchild in Hong Kong, TI in Taiwan.

      <li>
        Noyce and Moore found Intel and are the first to produce DRAM.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Japan starts producing higher-quality, cheaper DRAM. Taking most of its market share from USA companies.
      </li>
      <li>
        This happened due to heavy state subsidies for tech firms, low rates from banks and a focus on mass production.
      </li>
      <li>
        Japan(Nikon) also outperforms USA's lithography companies(GCA).

      <li>
        USA feels dependant on Japan, thus decreasing taxes for tech firms and pushing for coop.

        China was set back technologically from Dao's regime, Richard Chang founds SMIC, a foundry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Intel bets big on ASML('cause the only other rivals were Nikon and Canon and they're japanese) to develop extreme ultraviolet light lithography tools for smaller transistors.
      </li>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Only AMD and Intel manufacture their own chips, most of the other going fabless.

      <li>
        Logic chips mostly made by Intel and AMD. Memory - Korea(Samsung and SK hynix) and USA(Micron, tho mostly offshored). Other chips in Japan, USA and Europe.
      </li>
      <li>
        NVIDIA develops GPUs for graphics rendering, later find out that they're good for AI.
      </li>
      <li>
        Apple designs their own chips meaning that devices in their ecosystem work well together.

        The BIG GAMBLE on EUV and ASML paid off, new tools come out and fulfill yet another progression for Moore's law.

        Now TSMC and Samsung have the biggest foundries.

        China is so behind, only contributing to the assembly of electronics, that it sets out to reduce its semiconductor imports from 80% to 30% by ~2030.

      <li>
        China starts buying up foreign chip firms, hoping to get some technology transfered.

        Huawei in Shenzhen has become a leader of telecom and the biggest tech company in China. It has the best technology for integrating 5G, so future looks promising.

        Jinhua, a company in Fujian, China, steals documents from Micron to implement the technology themselves. USA responds by blocking exports of essential chip manufacturing equipment to the company.
      </li>
      <li>
        Trump also bans exports of advanced chips and tools to China, 'cause Huawei's looking like a real threat.
      </li>
      <li>
        USA still controls a big chunk of the semiconductor industry, especially some essential chokepoints like litography tools and chip design software.
      </li>
      <li>
        Today Taiwan produces 37% of the world's logic chips and 11% of memory chips. As China is getting pressured and blocked by the USA, it may be looking to put some pressure on Taiwan, as it is now in a far better position for war than ever before.
