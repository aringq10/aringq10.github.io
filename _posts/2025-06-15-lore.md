# Who is Ashpimpals?

Ashpimpals, a shadowy figure whispered of in the taverns of the Shattered Realms, is both legend and enigma. Born from the ashes of a ruined citadel, he commands fire not as a weapon, but as a memory—each flame a story of vengeance and rebirth. Cloaked in scorched robes and wielding the Emberbrand staff, Ashpimpals walks alone, hunted by kings and feared by sorcerers. His eyes, like burning coals, see the truth in lies. Some say he seeks redemption. Others claim he seeks to burn the world clean. Only the fire knows the truth—and it answers only to Ashpimpals.
